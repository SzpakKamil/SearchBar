**SearchBar** is a SwiftUI package that provides a highly customizable, native search bar component for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS. It leverages `UISearchBar` for iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS, and a SwiftUI-reimplemented `NSSearchField` for macOS, ensuring a seamless, platform-specific experience. With advanced customization options, accessibility features, and support for search tokens and suggestions, `SearchBar` is ideal for creating modern, user-focused search interfaces.

## Usage

The `SearchBar` component is a SwiftUI `View` that adapts to each platform, offering a simple yet powerful API for integration and customization.

### Basic Usage

A minimal setup for a functional search bar across platforms:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SearchBar

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var searchText = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            SearchBar(text: $searchText, prompt: "Search")
            Text("You typed: \(searchText)")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### Advanced Customization

Enhance the search bar with styling, tokens, and platform-specific features:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SearchBar

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var searchText = ""
    @State private var tokens: [SearchBarToken] = []

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            SearchBar(text: $searchText, prompt: "Filter Items")
                .searchBarStyle(.rounded, textColor: .blue, backgroundColor: .gray.opacity(0.1))
                .searchBarIconView { Image(systemName: "magnifyingglass") }
                .searchBarCurrentTokens($tokens)
                .searchBarSuggestions(.constant([
                    SearchBarSuggestion(text: "Apple", systemName: "apple.logo"),
                    SearchBarSuggestion(text: "Orange", systemName: "citrus")
                ]))
                #if os(iOS) || os(visionOS)
                .searchBarCancelButtonDisplayMode(.always)
                .searchBarKeyboardType(.default)
                #endif
