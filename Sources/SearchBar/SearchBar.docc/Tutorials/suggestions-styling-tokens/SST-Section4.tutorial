            @Step {
                Set the keyboard style to `.webSearch` by adding the `.searchBarKeyboardType(.webSearch)` modifier.

                }
            }
            @Step {
                Disable autocorrection for a streamlined search experience using the `.searchBarDisableAutocorrection(true)` modifier.

                }
            }
            @Step {
                Change the return key to a search-specific key by replacing the `.searchBarKeyboardType(.webSearch) with `.searchBarReturnKeyType(.search)` modifier.

            }
            @Step {
                For specific search fields, set the content type, such as `.emailAddress`, using the `.searchBarTextContentType(.emailAddress)` modifier.
