    ## Summary
    Congratulations on completing Chapter 2 of the Advanced Searcher project! You’ve significantly enhanced your SwiftUI-based iOS application by leveraging the SearchBar Framework to implement advanced search features. This chapter focused on improving user engagement and search efficiency through dynamic suggestions, token-based filtering, and tailored styling. These milestones provide a strong foundation for further refinements in interactivity and platform compatibility.

    Here’s a recap of the key achievements and skills you’ve gained in Chapter 2:

    - **Search Suggestions**: Boosted user engagement by implementing dynamic search suggestions with the `.searchBarSuggestions()` modifier, enabling movie title suggestions and refining responsiveness with `.searchBarEnableAutomaticSuggestionsFiltering()` and custom filtering logic (Tutorial: "Enhancing Your App with Search Suggestions").
    - **Genre Tokens**: Enhanced query refinement by adding genre token support using `.searchBarSuggestedTokens()` and `.searchBarCurrentTokens()`, allowing users to filter movies by genre seamlessly, with updated filtering logic to handle tokens and display "no results" messages (Tutorial: "Enhancing Search with Tokens").
    - **SearchBar Customization**: Tailored the SearchBar’s appearance to match the app’s aesthetic using `.searchBarStyle()` to set a capsule shape, blue text, cyan tint, blue token background, and a subtle background color. Personalized the icon with `.searchBarIconView()` (e.g., a book pages image) and configured display modes for clear and cancel buttons with `.searchBarClearButtonDisplayMode(.unlessEditing)` and `.searchBarCancelButtonDisplayMode(.always)` (Tutorial: "Customizing Your SearchBar").
    - **Keyboard Refinement**: Optimized the search input experience by customizing the keyboard with `.searchBarReturnKeyType(.search)`, disabling autocorrection via `.searchBarDisableAutocorrection(true)`, and setting a content type (e.g., `.emailAddress`) with `.searchBarTextContentType(.emailAddress)` for specific search fields (Tutorial: "Refining Search Input Styling").

    By mastering these features, you’ve built a highly functional Searcher app with an efficient, user-friendly search interface and advanced customization options. In the upcoming chapters, you’ll enhance interactivity with event-handling capabilities, such as dynamic UI updates, and finalize the app with multiplatform support for iOS, visionOS, and macOS, ensuring a seamless experience across diverse devices.
