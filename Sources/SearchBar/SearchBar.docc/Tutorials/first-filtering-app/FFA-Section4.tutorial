    ## Summary
    Congratulations on successfully completing Chapter 1 of the Searcher project! You’ve established a solid foundation for a multiplatform iOS application using the SearchBar Framework, creating an intuitive app that supports dynamic movie filtering. This milestone equips you with essential skills to build upon in future chapters with features like event handling, advanced search capabilities, and multiplatform optimization.

    Here’s a recap of the key achievements and skills you’ve acquired in Chapter 1:

    - **Project Setup and Integration**: Established a new Xcode project for the Searcher app and seamlessly integrated the SearchBar Framework via Swift Package Manager, configuring it for a multiplatform environment (Section: "Creating a Project").
    - **Data Model Design**: Created a well-organized file structure and developed robust data models, including a `Genre` enum with support for `Identifiable`, `Equatable`, `Comparable`, and `SearchBarToken` for enhanced filtering, and a `Movie` struct with properties for search and metadata, conforming to `Identifiable`, `Codable`, `Comparable`, and `Equatable` (Section: "Defining Data Models for Filtering").
    - **User Interface Construction**: Built a dynamic list screen using SwiftUI, featuring movies grouped by genre within a `NavigationStack`, with a custom `movieRow(for:)` function for consistent row styling. Integrated a styled `SearchBar` at the bottom of the screen for user-friendly interaction (Section: "Building App UI").
    - **Dynamic Filtering**: Implemented real-time filtering functionality using the SearchBar Framework, with a `filteredMovies` computed property to match movie titles based on `searchText`. Enhanced user experience with smooth animations, whitespace trimming, and a "No Results Found" message for empty search results (Section: "Building App UI").

    With these accomplishments, you’ve laid a strong foundation for a feature-rich filtering application. In upcoming chapters, you’ll explore advanced SearchBar capabilities, such as event-driven interactions, token-based filtering, and platform-specific optimizations, to craft a more engaging and versatile user experience.
