    ## Summary
    Well done on completing Chapter 3 of the Searcher project! You’ve significantly enhanced your Multiplatform iOS app by integrating robust event-handling capabilities using the SearchBar Framework. This chapter focused on making your app more interactive and efficient, enabling it to respond dynamically to user actions while optimizing performance. With these skills, you’re well-prepared for the final adjustments to ensure seamless support across all platforms.

    Here’s a recap of the key achievements and skills you’ve gained in Chapter 3:

    - **Event-Driven Navigation Updates**: Replaced focus-based logic with `searchBarBeginEditingAction()` and `searchBarEndEditingAction()` to dynamically update the navigation title, handling edge cases by considering search text and tokens with a `recomputeNavigationTitle(isEditing:)` function (Tutorial: "Handle Edge Cases with SearchBar Editing Events").
    - **Performance Optimization with Manual Filtering**: Transitioned from a computed `filteredMovies` property to a `@State` property updated via a `filterMovies(for:)` function, triggered by `searchBarChangeAction()`, improving performance for real-time movie filtering (Tutorial: "Optimize Search Performance with SearchBar Events").
    - **Dynamic UI Adjustments**: Leveraged event handlers to update the UI, such as toggling the navigation title between "Searcher" and "Search Results" based on editing state, and adjusted animations to use `filteredMovies` for smoother transitions (Tutorial: "Enhance Searcher with SearchBar Focus Handling").
    - **Efficient Event Management**: Streamlined SearchBar interactions by removing unnecessary state (`isSearching`) and using event modifiers like `searchBarChangeAction()` to handle text changes, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience (Tutorial: "Handle Edge Cases with SearchBar Editing Events").

    With these accomplishments, you’ve built a more responsive and efficient Searcher app that reacts seamlessly to user interactions. In the final chapter, you’ll focus on multiplatform support, refining the app for iOS, visionOS, and macOS with platform-specific tweaks, and tailored styling to ensure a consistent experience across all devices.
